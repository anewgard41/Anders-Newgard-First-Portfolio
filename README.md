It features stylizing HTML with advanced CSS. 
Through this project I was familiarized with Media-Querys for different screen sizes, responsive design using flexbox, box styling, pseudo-classes and elements, as well as many other techniques. 

I know this particular submission needs work, so thank you for taking the time to read through my code and critique my portfolio. I really appreciate it! 

HTML code sourced from In class examples with the instructor. Showed us the formatting of the HTML in class, I used this structure. 

CSS Styles for links from CSS-Tricks.com

Root css variables derived from in class examples. 

Reset.css page from in class examples as well.

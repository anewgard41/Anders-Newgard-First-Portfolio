          <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi everybody! My name is Anders Newgard but most people just call me Ders. I grew up in Chapel Hill, North Carolina and spent most of my life thinking I was going to be a veterinarian. I went to Colorado University and graduated with a degree in Pre-Veterinarian Sciences. I moved back to NC after graduating, and worked in a lab for animal behavior for a bit. After about 3 months of this, I quit, and got a job as a barista! I've been in the specialty coffee industry ever since, and now I manage a coffee shop in Chapel Hill. I love coffee, animals, technology, and a bunch of other things. I grew up a huge PC gamer, overall nerd, and have wanted to break into coding for along time now. I am extremely excited to have the opportunity to be apart of this program, and look forward to learning and mastering the necessary tools to become a professional developer.
            </p>

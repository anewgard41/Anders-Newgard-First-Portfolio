          <p>Hi everybody! My name is Anders but most people just call me Ders. I grew up in Chapel Hill, North Carolina and spent most of my life thinking I was going to be a veterinarian. 
            I went to Colorado University and graduated with a degree in Pre-Veterinarian Sciences. I moved back to NC after graduating, and worked in a lab for animal behavior for a bit. 
            After about 3 months of this, I quit, and got a job as a barista! I've been in the specialty coffee industry ever since, and now I manage a coffee shop here in Chapel Hill. 
            I love coffee, animals, technology, and a bunch of other things. I grew up a huge PC gamer, overall nerd, and have wanted to break into coding for along time now.
            I am extremely excited to have the opportunity to be apart of this program, and look forward to growing as a developer.</p>
